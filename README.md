## Description

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills in HTML, CSS/SCSS, GitHub by creating my own portfolio, in order to look for a job at the end of the course and show it to recruiters or employers.

### Functionality / Features

This project contains six html pages and thirteen scss partials. All of them share the same header (with a placeholder logo and the navigation bar) and footer (with the copyright and the links of my social media). 

I create one main page with six features:

1. Hero with a button who link to the contact component of my page underneath

2. Experience, with three cards: Skills, Education and Woek Experience

3. About me with a photo and a summary of myself
4. Projects  with three images that link to sandbox pages
5. Blog with five images that link to others pages
6. Contact with a form to send me an email via form spree

Then five pages for the blog posts with two features:

1. Article with a title, the published date, three paragraphs and a photo
2. Sidebar (only visible in Desktop view) that link to the others blog post
